Once our clients get their portfolio analytics, they adjust their holdings
to meet their objectives. In this lab you will create a new portfolio by
creating a csv file. Submit a portfolio that has an initial value less
than or equal to $10,000 on Jan-2-2020 and submit it to our leaderboard.
The best portfolio is the winner!

HINT: Returns are important, but they aren't the only thing that your
portfolio will be judged on.
* Is your portfolio risky?
* Can you make it less risky by adding other holdings?
