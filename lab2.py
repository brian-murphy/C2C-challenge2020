"""
Once parsed, we can run analytics on the portfolio. A simple metric is
how well the portfolio performs versus a benchmark. These can be other
portfolios, index funds, or fixed income instruments such as bonds.
For our benchmark we'll use the S&P 500 and calculate the portfolio's
adjusted returns compared to the benchmark.

get_historical_price(symbol, priceDate) will return the price for a security at a given date
